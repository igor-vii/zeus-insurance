# ⚡ Zeus Insurance – Decentralized Insurance Protocol for AI Agents

**Zeus Insurance** protects AI agents from financial losses caused by API and service failures. When a seller fails to deliver, the buyer receives automatic compensation from the protocol's reserve fund.

🚀 **Live on Base Sepolia** – ready for testing and integration.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

AI agents increasingly pay for API calls, data, and compute. But sellers may fail to respond — money is deducted, the agent receives nothing. Manual refunds are slow and require trust.

**Zeus solves this** by providing a trustless, on-chain insurance layer for agent-to-agent payments.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Buy Insurance** – The buyer pays a small premium (7–25% of the transaction amount) to insure an API call.
2. **Timeout** – If the seller does not respond within the specified time, the buyer becomes eligible for compensation.
3. **Claim Payout** – The buyer submits a claim, and the protocol automatically pays compensation from the reserve fund.

**Key features:**
- Fully on-chain, transparent, and auditable.
- Smart escrow logic ensures trustless execution.
- Premiums are pooled in a reserve fund to guarantee payouts.
- No central authority — everything is governed by smart contracts.

## 🏦 Reserve Fund

The reserve fund holds USDC and is managed by the `ZeusReserveV2` contract.

- **Premiums** automatically go to the reserve.
- **Payouts** are made from the reserve when claims are approved.
- **Daily payout limit:** 1,000 USDC (configurable).
- **Minimum reserve threshold:** 100 USDC (configurable).

This ensures that the protocol remains solvent and can handle multiple claims without external funding.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igor-vii/zeus-insurance.git
cd zeus-insurance
2. Install dependencies
bash
cd contracts
npm install
3. Set up environment
Create a .env file in the contracts folder:

env
PRIVATE_KEY=0xyour_private_key
4. Compile contracts
bash
npx hardhat compile
5. Run tests
bash
npx hardhat test
All 30+ tests should pass.

6. Deploy to Base Sepolia
bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-v2.js --network baseSepolia
🖥️ Frontend
The React frontend allows users to:

Connect MetaMask (Base Sepolia).

Buy insurance for API calls.

View all policies and their status.

Submit claims and receive payouts.

To run locally:

bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

🧪 Testing the Full Flow
Fund the reserve – Send USDC to ZeusReserveV2 via the admin panel or script.

Buy insurance – Use the frontend to create a policy.

Wait for timeout – Simulate seller failure by waiting for the timeout period.

Claim payout – Submit a claim and verify that compensation is sent from the reserve.
